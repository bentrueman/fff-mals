              Exposure to lead, copper, and manganese
              via
              drinking water is a public health concern. Modeling can account for solubility due to simple inorganic ligands but generally falls short in capturing the effects of natural organic matter, particles, and colloids; environmental data are needed to understand the importance of these species. Here, we demonstrate the use of asymmetric flow field flow fractionation with UV and ICP-MS detection to separate drinking water samples into ionic species, colloids, and metal–organic complexes. Colloidal iron appeared to be more important as a transport vector for lead, copper, and manganese than natural organic matter: estimated colloidal metals concentrations (Pb, Cu, Fe, Mn {\textgreater}1000 kDa) were at least 3 times greater than concentrations of these metals associated with the high apparent molecular weight (∼1 kDa) organic signal. In transmission electron micrographs, two distinct populations of relatively dense colloids in the size range 50–200 nm were apparent, with morphologies typical of environmental iron oxides. Moreover, energy dispersive spectroscopy showed that sample colloids were rich in iron, copper, and oxygen. At equilibrium (
              e.g.
              , during long stagnation periods in plumbing), high molecular weight organic and colloidal fractions represent additional capacity for drinking water to transport lead, which could have implications for water treatment to limit lead exposure.},

	abstract = {Silicates represent an alternative drinking water treatment for colour and turbidity due to iron. They may avoid the drawbacks of polyphosphates: increased lead solubility, the potential for increased bacterial growth, and phosphorus in wastewater.
          , 
            
              Maintaining drinking water quality during distribution requires a range of tools to ensure chemical stability at the tap. Coloured water is a primary concern, and sodium silicates have been reported to reduce colour from iron. However, the impacts of water quality and the interactions between sodium silicate and iron oxides are not well characterized in this context. We conducted a bench-scale factorial experiment (2
              4
              ) to evaluate the effect of sodium silicate on colour and turbidity with pH, humic acid, free chlorine, and sodium silicate as independent variables. Sodium silicate reduced colour and turbidity due to particulate iron by 113.3 Pt–Co and 4.0 NTU, respectively. Sodium silicate reduced the size of iron particles, as determined by dynamic light scattering and laser diffraction, and increased the apparent density, as assessed by electron microscopy. XRD and XPS data were consistent with increased amorphous and oxyhydroxide content in iron precipitates exposed to sodium silicate. Silicate also inhibited the adsorption of humic acid onto model iron oxides due to electrostatic repulsion: the zeta (
              ζ
              -) potentials of iron oxides in silicate-treated systems were substantially more negative.},

According to our results, Pb was generally found as large colloids ({\textgreater}300 kDa) and was removed in the salinity range 0–10 from all of the size fractions where it was significantly found. Because the colloidal fractionation of Pb was strongly linked to that of iron (Fe) and humic substances (HS), the removal of Pb in the mixing area must occur under flocculation of organomineral complexes. A key period corresponding to the first strong autumnal precipitations was also revealed in the present work. At this time of the year, the mobilisation of Pb (and Fe) from catchment soils is enhanced by the mobilisation of HS and the metal is associated with smaller colloids (30–300 kDa).},

	abstract = {Pipe loop studies are used to evaluate corrosion control treatment, and updated regulatory guidance will ensure that they remain important for water quality management. But the data they generate are difficult to analyze: non-linear time-trends, non-detects, extreme values, and autocorrelation are common features that make popular methods, such as the t- or rank-sum tests, poor descriptive models. Here, we propose a model for pipe loop data that accommodates many of these difficult-to-model characteristics: a robust Bayesian generalized additive model with continuous-time autoregressive errors. Our approach facilitates corrosion control treatment comparisons without the need for imputing non-detects or special handling of outliers. It is well-suited to describing nonlinear trends without overfitting, and it accounts for the reduced information content in autocorrelated time series. We demonstrate it using a four-year pipe loop study, with multiple pipe configurations and orthophosphate dosing protocols, finding that an initially high dose of orthophosphate (2 mg P L-1) that is subsequently lowered (0.75 mg P L-1) can yield lower lead release than an intermediate dose (1 mg P L-1) in the long term.},

Adsorption of lead by the manganese oxides was up to 40 times greater than that by the iron oxides, and lead was adsorbed more strongly than any of the other ions studied by all of the oxides except goethite. This is considered to be the reason for the accumulation of lead in the manganese oxides in soils. No evidence was found for the oxidation of lead, nor for the formation of specific lead-manganese minerals.},
